## What I Learnt

A landing page for law and justice created using HTML5 and CSS3 which helped me to understand the CSS Position property as well as flexbox concepts. Here I got a chance to explore the CSS Position Property. After quite a bit of hit and trail I got a clarity on the values on what to use when. I had also explored flexbox concepts. Overall It was a great experience.
